# Haxaw-Chess

**Haxaw**: Haxaw is the Neural Network based chess engine made with Python and Tensorflow/Keras. Also uses the [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) library. (WIP: *Implement minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms*)

**Diagonal**: Diagonal is the GUI written with pygame. Currently you can play games as white against Haxaw.
