# Haxaw-Chess

**Haxaw**: Haxaw is the Neural Network based chess engine made with Python and Tensorflow/Keras. Also uses the [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) library. Currently very bad and slow. (WIP: *Needs major speed and evaluation upgrades*)

**Diagonal**: Diagonal is the GUI written with pygame. Currently you can play games as white against Haxaw.
